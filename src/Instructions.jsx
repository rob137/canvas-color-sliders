        The canvas below contains a grayscale image of part of a cell from the
        Nanoimager. Note the image is actually saved as an RGBA PNG file, with
        identical values in the Red, Green, and Blue channels to produce gray.
        <br />
        In biological imaging, we usually apply colormaps to our images, mapping
        from grayscale values to a more colorful scale with a look-up table.{" "}

          This blog post
        </a>{" "}
        contains some more explanation. <br />
        Please create some components to help us to apply colormaps to this
        image. You should use React hooks to manage state; an example to build
        upon is shown in the brightness slider. <br />
        As an extra challenge, a 3-channel image is included in this project's
        "public" folder, and we would like to be able to apply colormaps to each
        channel individually. <br />
        Finally, please feel free to embelish this sandbox with whatever styling
        you deem appropriate.
